# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project keeps its versioning in `package.json`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Changelog tracking for user-facing changes.
- Detailed architecture documentation in [docs/arquitectura-sistema.md](docs/arquitectura-sistema.md).
- Explicit documentation of the local Ollama model used by the AI flow: `qwen3.5:4b`.

### Changed
- Keep the latest implementation notes here before each release.
- The AI prompt now includes lightweight retrieval over previously stored questions and answers, in addition to product context.
- The README now includes an executive overview, endpoint summary, and environment variable summary.
- Failed AI interactions are now persisted with `estado`, `errorMessage`, and `errorStatus` so error cases are auditable.
- The chatbot can now answer weather, time, holiday, and country-data questions through external tools before falling back to Ollama or OpenRouter.
- The documentation now explains supported intents, routing behavior, persistence rules, and known limitations.
- The request payload now controls the AI route correctly again: `agente=true` uses OpenRouter and `agente=false` or omitted uses Ollama.
- Weather queries now default to `Paraná, Entre Rios, Argentina` when the user does not provide a city.
- Placeholder greeting responses like `HOLA` are no longer persisted as successful AI answers.
- The AI prompt now explicitly rejects greeting-only outputs so Ollama/OpenRouter must return a substantive answer before it is saved.

### Fixed
- Record bug fixes that affect API behavior, validation, or deployment.
